                Hi there - My name is Lucas Nunes and this is my marvelous portfolio. I created this page
                while enrolled in Rutgers Bootcamp. I intend on building more on this page in order to submit as
                my professional portfolio. Of course all these pages start bland, but with some good CSS and javascript 
                they can become awesome and interactive. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Outside of this course, I am an IT Tech for Ernst & Young and provide onsite support for our customers. I have been 
                in the IT field since graduating college back in 2015. Although I received a programming degree I never seriously pursued 
                a development role until now. I am eager to get the software engineer position I've dreamed of. 
                And outside my IT Career, I am your typical, cliche traveller and love to drink! 
                <br>
                <br>
                I've included two tabs, one to my contact page and the second to my portfolio work. Please feel free to poke around. 
                Here are some of my contact details: <a href="mailto:#" >john.smith@gmail.com</a>.
